# whawty.nginx-sso

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/whawty/nginx-sso)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/whawty/nginx-sso)

whawty-nginx-sso is a simple agent that can be used to implement a cookie-based SSO scheme for
the web. For this purpose the agent hosts a login form to prompt users for login credentials.
These credentials are then verified using the configured authentication backend and in case they
match a session cookie will be generated. The cookie is signed using an asymmetric signature
algorithm and can whence be verfied by other whawty-nginx-sso instances which don't need to have
access to the private signing key.
To control the access to services the whawty-nginx-sso agent offers a endpoint intended to be
used with the [ngx_http_auth_request_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_auth_request_module.html).
Depending on the cookie options configured the session-cookies generated can be used for all
services of a given domain. Even if those services are hosted by different machines as long as
they are published by nginx. Either directly or in the form of a reverse-proxy.

At the moment whawty-nginx-sso has support for 3 authentication backends

 * static files (htpasswd)
 * [whawty-auth](https://github.com/whawty/auth) (including support for remote-upgrades)
 * LDAP

For now whawty-nginx-sso only supports username and passwords but there are plans to support
multi-factor authentication as long as the authentication backend supports it.
Also it is currently not possible to invalidate active sessions. This means that cookies stay
valid until they reach their pre-determined lifetime. Keep this in mind when configuring the
cookie expiry duration. However the goal of the project is to implement a scheme to prematurely
expire cookies before the 1.0 release.
