NAME
----

whawty-nginx-sso - simple SSO system for nginx


SYNOPSIS
--------

*whawty-nginx-sso*  '[global options]' *<command>* '[command options]' '[arguments ... ]'


DESCRIPTION
-----------

*whawty-nginx-sso* is a simple agent that can be used to implement a cookie-based SSO scheme for
the web. For this purpose the agent hosts a login form to prompt users for login credentials.
These credentials are then verified using the configured authentication backend and in case they
match a session cookie will be generated. The cookie is signed using an asymmetric signature
algorithm and can whence be verfied by other *whawty-nginx-sso* instances which don't need to have
access to the private signing key.
To control the access to services the *whawty-nginx-sso* agent offers a endpoint intended to be
used with the ngx_http_auth_request_module. Depending on the cookie options configured the session-
cookies generated can be used for all services of a given domain. Even if those services are hosted
by different machines as long as they are published by nginx. Either directly or in the form of a
reverse-proxy.

--------------

The following global options can be passed to *whawty-nginx-sso*.

*-h | --help*::

as specified by the global store configuration file.
